GlitchY Bot Privacy Policy

Information the bot can access
GlitchY can access server information such as channels, roles, members, and messages in the servers where it is added.

Information the bot collects
GlitchY may store data such as:

Server IDs and channel IDs

User IDs involved in moderation actions or tickets

Configuration settings for the bot

Logs that are needed for moderation features and tickets

GlitchY does not store message content unless it is necessary for a specific feature such as logs or tickets.

How the information is used
The collected data is used only to provide and improve bot features, such as moderation, logs, and ticket support. The data is not sold or shared with third parties.

Data retention and deletion
Data is kept for as long as it is needed for the bot’s features or until a server owner or user asks for it to be deleted. Server owners or users can request deletion of stored data by opening a ticket in the GlitchY support server.

Who can access the data
Only the GlitchY bot developers/owners have access to the stored data. Access is limited to maintaining and improving the bot and handling support or moderation.

Security
Reasonable steps are taken to protect stored data and to prevent unauthorized access. However, no system can be perfectly secure, and use of the bot is at your own risk.

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or want to request your data or its deletion, you can contact the GlitchY team by opening a ticket in the GlitchY support Discord server.
